**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
There are no other pending tasks. The project is in the final polishing stage.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Initial Scaffolding:** Created a multi-page Next.js application (Landing, Offer, Ramadan, Booking).
-   **Content & Personalization:**
    -   Integrated all Arabic content, including user-provided testimonials and coach's name.
    -   Added the coach's professional photo as a circular image on the landing page.
-   **Iterative Refinements (based on user feedback):**
    -   Adjusted consultation duration from 60 to 45 minutes site-wide.
    -   Refined marketing copy multiple times (e.g., tens of clients instead of 120+, business people instead of executives, works despite your work pressure instead of works with travel...).
    -   Corrected grammar and phrasing (e.g., من رجال الأعمال...).
    -   Removed redundant text like in Arabic.
-   **Payment & Booking Flow:**
    -   Implemented a payment flow using an external PayPal link.
    -   Updated the post-payment instructions to direct users to book via a Calendly link they will receive by email.
-   **Bug Fixes & Styling:**
    -   Resolved a build error that was causing blank screenshots.
    -   Fixed CSS to center buttons on the booking page.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None. All issues raised by the user during the session were addressed.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
None. This is the first session for this project.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
-   **Styling:** Global CSS with CSS variables.
-   **Language:** JavaScript (React)
-   **Architecture:** Static Site Generation (SSG) - it's a frontend-only application with no backend logic or database.

**key DB schema**
N/A. This is a frontend-only project with no database.

**changes in tech stack**
None.

**All files of reference**
-   : The main landing page. Modified extensively with content and styling.
-   : The booking page. Its logic was changed several times to reflect the final user flow.
-   : The offer page. Content was updated.
-   : The main stylesheet. Recently modified to add the  variable.
-   : A markdown file created to store important external links like PayPal and Calendly.
-   : A markdown file with templates for WhatsApp communication.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The code in  went through several iterations. While the agent mentioned simplifying it, a quick review to ensure no dead code or unused state variables from previous flows exist would be beneficial.

**key api endpoints**
N/A.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **User Flow is Manual:** The website does **not** automatically verify payment or send the booking link. It only redirects to PayPal. The coach (user) is responsible for manually verifying the payment and then emailing the Calendly link to the client. This has been a point of discussion, and the current implementation is the user's final decision.
-   **Business Questions:** The user asked about website ownership and ongoing fees. The previous agent correctly deferred this to the support team. Avoid making any commitments on these topics.
-   **Design Goal:** The primary goal of the current task is to elevate the design to feel more premium and executive by integrating an elegant blue color.
